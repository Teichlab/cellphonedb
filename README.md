# CellPhoneDB

## What is CellPhoneDB?
CellPhoneDB is a publicly available repository of curated receptors, ligands and their interactions. Subunit architecture is included for both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. This is crucial, as cell-cell communication relies on multi-subunit protein complexes that go beyond the binary representation used in most databases and studies.

CellPhoneDB integrates [existing datasets](Docs/ppi-resources.md) that pertain to cellular communication and new manually reviewed information. Databases from which CellPhoneDB gets information are: UniProt, Ensembl, PDB, the IMEx consortium, IUPHAR.

CellPhoneDB can be used to search for a particular ligand/receptor, or interrogate your own single-cell transcriptomics data.


## Starting to use CellPhoneDB 

To start using CellPhoneDB, you can use our interactive web application ([cellphonedb.org](https://www.cellphonedb.org)) and run in the analysis in our private cloud, or just run CellPhoneDB with your own computational resources. (The latter is preferable if you are going to work with big datasets).


### Installing CellPhoneDB
NOTE: Works with Python v3.6 or greater. If your default Python interpreter is for `v2.x` (you can check it with `python --version`), calls to `python`/`pip` should be substituted by `python3`/`pip3`.

We highly recommend using an isolated python environment (as described in steps 1 and 2) using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) but you could of course omit these steps and install via `pip` immediately.

1. Create python=>3.6 environment
- Using conda: `conda create -n cpdb python=3.7`
- Using virtualenv: `python -m venv cpdb`

2. Activate environment
- Using conda: `source activate cpdb`
- Using virtualenv: `source cpdb/bin/activate`

3. Install CellPhoneDB `pip install cellphonedb`


## Running CellPhoneDB Methods

Please, activate your environment if you didn't previously
- Using conda: `source activate cpdb`
- Using virtualenv: `source cpdb/bin/activate`

To use the example data, please [download meta/counts test data](https://github.com/Teichlab/cellphonedb/blob/master/in/example_data/cellphonedb_example_data.zip?raw=true). i.e.
```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Teichlab/cellphonedb/master/in/example_data/test_counts.txt --output test_counts.txt
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Teichlab/cellphonedb/master/in/example_data/test_meta.txt --output test_meta.txt
```

Note: counts file can be a text file or `h5ad` (recoommended), `h5` or a path to a folder containing `mtx/barcode/features`.


####  Example with running the statistical method
```shell
cellphonedb method statistical_analysis test_meta.txt test_counts.txt
```


#### Example without using the statistical method
**Using text files**
```shell
cellphonedb method analysis test_meta.txt test_counts.txt 
```

**Using h5ad count file**
```shell
cellphonedb method analysis test_meta.txt test_counts.h5ad
```

Please check the [results documentation](Docs/RESULTS-DOCUMENTATION.md) in order to understand the results.

## Plotting statistical method results

In order to plot results from the statistical methods, you need to run it first.

Currently there are two plot types available: `dot_plot` & `heatmap_plot`

Once you have the needed files (`means` & `pvalues`) you can proceed as follows:
```shell
cellphonedb plot dot_plot
```

```shell
cellphonedb plot heatmap_plot yourmeta.txt
```

### `dot_plot`
This plot type requires `ggplot2` R package installed and working

You can tweak the options for the plot with these arguments:
- `--means-path`: The means output file [./out/means.txt]
- `--pvalues-path`: The pvalues output file [./out/pvalues.txt]
- `--output-path`: Output folder [./out]
- `--output-name`: Filename of the output plot [plot.pdf]
- `--rows`: File with a list of rows to plot, one per line [all available]
- `--columns`: File with a list of columns to plot, one per line [all available]
- `--verbose / --quiet`: Print or hide CellPhoneDB logs [verbose]

Available output formats are those supported by `R's ggplot2` package, among others they are:
- `pdf`
- `png`
- `jpeg`

This format will be inferred from the `--output-name` argument

To plot only desired rows/columns (samples for [rows](in/example_data/rows.txt) and [columns](in/example_data/columns.txt) based in example data files):
```shell
cellphonedb plot dot_plot --rows in/rows.txt --columns in/columns.txt
``` 

### `heatmap_plot`
This plot type requires `pheatmap` R package installed and working 
This plot type includes two features `count` & `log_count` 

You can tweak the options for the plot with these arguments:
- `--pvalues-path`: The pvalues output file [./out/pvalues.txt]
- `--output-path`: Output folder [./out]
- `--count-name`: Filename of the output plot [heatmap_count.pdf]
- `--log-name`: Filename of the output plot using log-count of interactions [heatmap_log_count.pdf]
- `--count-network-name`: Filename of the output network file [count_network.txt]
- `--interaction-count-name`: Filename of the output interactions-count file [interactions_count.txt] 
- `--pvalue`: pvalue threshold to consider when plotting [0.05]
- `--verbose / --quiet`: Print or hide cellphonedb logs [verbose]

Available output formats are those supported by `R's pheatmap` package, among others they are:
- `pdf`
- `png`
- `jpeg`

This format will be inferred from the `--count-name` & `--log-name` arguments.


## Using different database versions
CellPhoneDB databases can be updated from the remote repository through our tool. Furthermore, available versions can be listed and downloaded for use. 

To use one of those versions, a user must provide the argument `--database <version_or_file>` to the method to be executed.

If the given parameter is a readable database file, it will be used as is. Otherwise it will use some of the versions matching the selected version.

If the selected version does not exist in the local environment it will be downloaded from the remote repository. (See below.) If no `--database` argument is given in methods execution, it will use the latest local version available.

Downloaded versions will be stored in a user folder under `~/.cpdb/releases`

## Listing remote available versions
The command to list available versions from the remote repository is:
```shell
cellphonedb database list_remote
``` 

## Listing local available versions
The command to list available versions from the local repository is:
```shell
cellphonedb database list_local
``` 

## Download version
The command to download a version from the remote repository is:
```shell
cellphonedb database download
``` 
or 

```shell 
cellphonedb database download --version <version_spec|latest> 
``` 

whereby `version_spec` must be one of the listed in the `database list_remote` command.
If no version is specified or `latest` is used as a `version_spec`, the newest available version will be downloaded


## Generating user-specific custom database
A user can generate custom databases and use them. In order to generate a new database, a user can provide his/her own lists.

These lists can be: genes, proteins, complexes and/or interactions. In the generation process they will get merged with the ones from the CellPhoneDB release sources. The user lists have higher precedence than the ones included in CellPhoneDB package.

To generate such a database the user has to issue this command:
```shell
cellphonedb database generate  
```
Generate specific parameters:

- `--user-protein`: Protein input file
- `--user-gene`: Gene input file
- `--user-complex`: Complex input file
- `--user-interactions`: Interactions input file
- `--fetch`: Some lists can be downloaded from original sources while creating the database, eg: uniprot, ensembl. By default, the snapshots included in the CellPhoneDB package will be used; to enable a fresh copy `--fetch` must be appended to the command
- `--result-path`: Output folder
- `--log-file`: Log file
- `--user-interactions-only`: Use only interactions provided.

Result database file is generated in the folder `out` with `cellphonedb_user_{datetime}.db`. The user defined input tables will be merged with the current CellPhoneDB input tables. To use this database, please use `--database` parameter in methods.
E.g:
```
 cellphonedb method statistical_analysis in/example_data/test_meta.txt in/example_data/test_counts.txt --database out/cellphonedb_user_2019-05-10-11_10.db
```

### Examples for user-specific custom database

1. To add or correct some interactions

    **Input**:
    
    - `your_custom_interaction_file.csv`: Comma separated file (use mandatory columns!) with interactions to add/correct.
     
    **Command**:
    
    ```shell
    cellphonedb database generate --user-interactions your_custom_interaction_file.csv 
    ```
    **Result**:
    
    New database file with CellPhoneDB interactions + user custom interactions. For duplicated interactions, user lists overwrite the CellPhoneDB original data.

2. To use only user-specific interactions
    
    **Input**:
    
    - `your_custom_interaction_file.csv`: Comma separated file (use mandatory columns!) with interactions to use.
    
    **Command**:
    
    ```shell
    cellphonedb database generate --user-interactions your_custom_interaction_file.csv --user-interactions-only
    ```
    **Result**:
    
    New database file with **only** user custom interactions. 

3. To correct any protein data
    
    **Input**:
    - `your_custom_protein_file.csv`: Comma separated file (use mandatory columns!) with proteins to overwrite. 
     
    **Command**:
    ```shell
    cellphonedb database generate --user-protein your_custom_protein_file.csv 
    ```
    **Result**:
    
    New database file with CellPhoneDB interactions + user custom interactions. For duplicated interactions or proteins, user lists overwrite the CellPhoneDB original data.

4. To add some interactions and correct any protein data
    
    **Input**:
    
    - `your_custom_interaction_file.csv`: Comma separated file (use mandatory columns!) with interactions to add/correct.
    - `your_custom_protein_file.csv`: Comma separated file (use mandatory columns!) with proteins to overwrite. 
    
    **Command**:
    
    ```shell
    cellphonedb database generate --user-interactions your_custom_interaction_file.csv --user-protein your_custom_protein_file.csv 
    ```
    **Result**:
    
    New database file with CellPhoneDB interactions + user custom interactions. On duplicated interactions or proteins, user list overwrites CellPhoneDB original data.    
     
5. To update remote sources (UniProt, IMEx, ensembl, etc.)     
    
    **IMPORTANT**
    
    This command uses external resources allocated in external servers. The command may not end correctly if external servers are not available. The timing of this step depends on external servers and the user's internet connection and can take a lot of time. 
    
    **Input**:
    
    - `your_custom_interaction_file.csv`: Comma separated file (use mandatory columns!) with interactions to add/correct.
    - `your_custom_protein_file.csv`: Comma separated file (use mandatory columns!) with proteins to overwrite. 
    
    **Command**:
    
    ```shell
    cellphonedb database generate --fetch 
    ```
    **Result**:
    
    New database file with CellPhoneDB interactions + user custom interactions. For duplicated interactions or proteins, user lists overwrite the CellPhoneDB original data.
    
    
Some lists can be downloaded from original sources while creating the database, e.g. uniprot, ensembl. By default, the snapshots included in the CellPhoneDB package will be used---to enable a fresh copy `--fetch` must be appended to the command.

In order to use specific lists those can be specified like this `--user-protein`, `--user-gene`, `--user-complex`, `--user-interactions`, `--user-interactions-only`
followed by the corresponding file path.

The database file can be then used as explained below. The intermediate lists used for the generation will be saved along the database itself.

As the lists are processed, then filtered, and lastly collected, two versions may exist: `_generated` is the unfiltered one whereas `_input` is the final state prior being inserted in the database.
